Bringing higher-level concepts to VBA Access

# Introduction

There are much more advanced languages than VBA (e.g. Python), but here it is, you have to work with Ms-Access. Is everything lost? No!
The ecosystem is actually quite rich. It's only that it's not immediately accessible and not many people really bothered to work things
out in a way that they could be used by others.

There are actually things that you can do, with this set of modules:

1. **Databases**: Use rows from tables, as everyone in their right mind would do today: as dictionaries.
2. **RegExp2**: Using regexps in your application easily.
2. **Parameter**: How about a little parameter table for your app, with all whistles and bells?

## How to Install

Nothing fancy here:
- Download the modules (`Database.bas`, `Parameter.bas`and `RegExp2.bas`
- From the VBA editor, import them in your Access application
- Set up the libraries you need (they are indicated in the header of your module).
